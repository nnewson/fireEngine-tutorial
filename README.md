# Fire Engine Tutorial
[![CI](https://github.com/nnewson/fireEngine-tutorial/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nnewson/fireEngine-tutorial/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A tutorial for building a 3D engine step-by-step.
Based on [FireEngine](https://github.com/nnewson/fireEngine) and documented
under the development blog at [nnewson.github.io](https://nnewson.github.io)

## Build and run

vcpkg is used to manage dependencies. Install it from
[vcpkg.io](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html). The vcpkg configuration
pins a registry baseline so local and CI builds resolve the same dependency
versions.

Set `VCPKG_ROOT` to a vcpkg checkout, then configure and build:

```sh
cmake --preset vcpkg
cmake --build --preset default
./build/fireEngineTutorial
```

Debug builds enable Vulkan validation when the standard validation layer is
installed. Validation is disabled for every other build configuration.

Or run the same executable through CTest:

```sh
ctest --preset default
```

The executable links the Vulkan loader supplied by vcpkg and uses GLFW to open a
window and create its platform surface. A Vulkan driver must still be installed
on the machine, and must expose Vulkan 1.4, dynamic rendering, synchronization 2,
and swapchain presentation support.

On macOS, this tutorial targets the KosmicKrisp technical preview from the
[LunarG Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/1.4.357.0/mac/getting_started.html).
It requires Apple Silicon and macOS 26. Once the SDK installer has registered
its driver manifest in the standard Vulkan search path, the executable runs
without sourcing the SDK environment. `VK_DRIVER_FILES` remains available as an
optional override when selecting among multiple installed drivers.

The executable does not directly link KosmicKrisp or enable the unsupported
Vulkan portability extensions. At this milestone the GLFW window closes as soon
as device selection and logical-device creation have completed successfully.
